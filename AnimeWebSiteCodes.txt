            <h3 id="Text1">
              Manga is a style of Japanese comic books and graphic novels that
              originated in Japan. The term "manga" is used to refer to both the
              comic strips and comic books. It covers a wide range of genres and
              is targeted at diverse age groups, including children, teenagers,
              and adults. Manga is characterized by its distinctive art style,
              with characters having large, expressive eyes and often
              exaggerated facial expressions. The storytelling in manga
              typically follows a right-to-left and top-to-bottom reading
              format, which is opposite to the traditional left-to-right format
              used in Western comics. Manga covers a vast array of genres,
              including action, adventure, romance, science fiction, fantasy,
              horror, slice of life, and many more. It has become popular
              worldwide, and many manga series have been translated into various
              languages. Manga is not limited to print media; it has also
              expanded into other forms of media, such as anime (animated TV
              shows and films), live-action adaptations, and merchandise. Many
              well-known manga series have gained international acclaim and have
              a significant impact on popular culture globally.

            <h3 id="mangakas">
              Manga-ka (漫画家) is a manga artist, who writes and/or illustrates
              manga. Most manga artists study at an art college or manga school
              or take on an apprenticeship with another artist before entering
              the industry as a primary creator. More rarely a manga artist
              breaks into the industry directly, without previously being an
              assistant. For example, Naoko Takeuchi, author of Sailor Moon, won
              a Kodansha Manga Award contest and manga pioneer Osamu Tezuka was
              first published while studying an unrelated degree, without
              working as an assistant. A manga artist will rise to prominence
              through recognition of their ability when they spark the interest
              of institutions, individuals or a demographic of manga consumers.
              For example, there are contests which prospective manga artist may
              enter, sponsored by manga editors and publishers. This can also be
              accomplished through producing a one-shot. While sometimes a
              stand-alone manga, with enough positive reception it can be
              serialized in a weekly, monthly, or quarter
            </h3>

            <h1 id="mangaArtsist">Becoming a manga artist</h1>
            <h3 id="aboutmangaArtists">
              Traditionally in order to become a manga artist, one would need to
              send their work into a competition held by various publishing
              companies. If they won their work would be published and they
              would be assigned an editor and officially "debut" as a manga
              artist. Nowadays there are many self-published manga artists on
              the internet posting their work on websites. It is possible for
              these manga artists' works to be officially picked up by a
              publishing company, such as Shueisha. For example, One-Punch Man
              started off as a webcomic before Shueisha began publishing a manga
              remake on Tonari No Young Jump.

    <h1 id="satauri">History Of Anime</h1>

    <br>
    <h2 id="shesavali">
       
      Anime has a fascinating history that spans over a century, evolving from
      its early roots to becoming a global cultural phenomenon. Here's a more
      detailed look at the history of anime:
      </h2>
</br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<ol>
    <li id="list1">Pre-World War II (1920s-1930s):</li>


<h3 id="FirstAnime">
    The first Japanese animation is often attributed to Jun'ichi Kōuchi, who created "Namakura Gatana" 
    (An Obtuse Sword) in 1917. 
    During the 1930s, animated shorts and feature films began to emerge, with works like "Katsudō Shashin" 
    (Moving Picture) in 1907.

<br>
<br>
<br>
<li id="secondList"> World War II and Propaganda (1940s):</li>
<h3 id="text2">
    Anime production during World War II was heavily influenced by government propaganda. 
    "Momotaro, Umi no Shinpei" (Momotaro, Sacred Sailors) in 1945 is an example, featuring 
    anthropomorphic animals promoting nationalistic values.

<li class="list3">Post-War Period (1950s):</li>
<h3 id="text3"> 
    Osamu Tezuka, often called the "God of Manga," played a crucial role in shaping anime. 
    His iconic work "Astro Boy" (Tetsuwan Atom) in 1963 marked the beginning of modern anime.
    The industry began to grow, and television became a popular medium for anime distribution.</h3>

      <h3 id="aboutNaruto">
        "Naruto" is a Japanese manga and anime series created by Masashi
        Kishimoto. The story follows Naruto Uzumaki, a young ninja with dreams
        of becoming the strongest ninja and earning the title of Hokage, the
        leader of his village, the Hidden Leaf Village (Konohagakure). The
        series is set in a fictional world where ninja villages exist, and
        individuals train in the art of ninjutsu and other techniques. Naruto is
        an orphan who grew up facing prejudice and loneliness because he is the
        host of the Nine-Tailed Fox, a powerful and malevolent creature that
        attacked the village years before. Despite the challenges, Naruto is
        determined to prove himself and gain the acceptance of his fellow
        villagers. As the story progresses, Naruto goes through various
        missions, battles, and challenges alongside his friends and fellow
        ninjas, such as Sasuke Uchiha and Sakura Haruno. The series explores
        themes of friendship, perseverance, and the pursuit of one's dreams.
        Additionally, it delves into the complexities of ninja politics,
        conflicts between villages, and the mysteries surrounding Naruto's own
        origins. The sequel to "Naruto" is "Boruto: Naruto Next Generations,"
        which follows Naruto's son, Boruto Uzumaki, and his adventures as a
        ninja.

      <img class="onepunchmanImg" src="onepunchman.jpe" alt="onepunchman" />
      <h3 id="aboutOnepunchMan">
        "One Punch Man" is a Japanese superhero anime and manga series created
        by the artist ONE. The story follows Saitama, an unremarkable man who
        becomes a hero just for fun. However, Saitama is no ordinary hero—he
        possesses overwhelming strength and can defeat any opponent with a
        single punch. As a result, he becomes bored with the lack of challenge
        in his battles. The series explores themes of heroism, the pursuit of
        purpose, and the consequences of overwhelming power. Despite his
        incredible strength, Saitama struggles with feelings of emptiness and a
        desire for a worthy adversary. Along the way, he encounters other
        heroes, monsters, and various villains, creating a mix of action,
        comedy, and satire. The humor in "One Punch Man" often arises from the
        stark contrast between Saitama's nonchalant attitude and his seemingly
        invincible abilities, as well as the exaggerated nature of superhero
        tropes and conventions. The series has gained popularity for its unique
        take on the superhero genre and its blend of action and humor.
